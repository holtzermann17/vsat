Create a file `.env` at the root of the project:

```shell
touch .env
```

Populate it with the following environment variables:

```
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=
CLOUDINARY_URL=
MAGIC_SECRET_KEY=
MAGIC_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
NODE_V8_COVERAGE=./coverage
```

Optional (development only):

```
DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=1
DEV_AUTH_BYPASS_EMAIL=dev@localhost
DEV_AUTH_BYPASS_NAME=Dev User
DEV_DISABLE_COEP=1
DEV_DISABLE_OVERLAY=1
DEV_API_PORT=3001
STEWARD_EMAILS=steward@example.com,second@example.com
DEV_STEWARD_TOGGLE=1
```

`DEV_AUTH_BYPASS` only applies when `NODE_ENV=development` and the request host
is local (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, or `*.localhost`).
